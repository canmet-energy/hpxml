Steps to HPXML Implementation
*****************************

A well-designed implementation plan is necessary to successfully integrate HPXML into program operations. This section will walk you through the process of implementing HPXML and provide guidance that can serve as a starting point for an implementation plan. 

Each jurisdiction will have different goals, market needs, and regulatory requirements that will influence the scope of the HPXML project. However, leveraging the experiences of programs that have already implemented HPXML can lower individual implementation costs and help drive alignment between utility jurisdictions.
