Standard HPXML Datasets
#######################

The standard datasets each specify a specific set of elements required for some typical use cases of HPXML. These have been developed by the working group as a consensus. Each standard dataset is described in more detail at :doc:`/standard_datasets`, and the enumerated list of elements for each dataset can be found at the `online data dictionary <https://hpxml.nrel.gov/datadictionary>`_ or :ref:`datatool`. This section of the documentation is meant to describe the structure, organization, and technical details of each dataset.
